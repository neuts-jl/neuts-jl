# Hello, I'm Jean-Luc Neuts ðŸ‘‹

I am passionate about electronics and computers. I had the pleasure of making a career in these two complementary professions.

During my career, I have programmed in more than 50 programming languages â€‹â€‹from the 6800, 8080, Z80 assembler to the advanced languages â€‹â€‹Prolog, Python, Julia and on about twenty OS.

I have designed electronic cards and complex systems in robotics, wire guidance... in the automotive field

Today, I develop according to my inspiration in a few languages, including LAZARUS, one of my favorites.
I am still interested in electronics but using ready-made modules: esp32, arduino, raspberry....
